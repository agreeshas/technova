 Project Description

Relationship Health Monitor is an AI-powered web application that analyzes text messages and voice recordings to detect red flags and green flags in relationships. It evaluates emotional patterns, assigns a health score, and provides supportive insights to help users recognize toxic or healthy communication.

The Problem Statement

Many people experience emotional manipulation, gaslighting, guilt-tripping, or unhealthy communication in relationships but fail to recognize these patterns early. Subtle toxic behaviors often go unnoticed until serious emotional harm occurs.

 The Solution

Our solution uses AI to analyze conversations (text or audio) and detect behavioral patterns in real time. The system identifies red flags, green flags, calculates a relationship health score, and provides actionable insights and support resources to empower users with awareness.

 Project Documentation

Relationship Health Monitor works in three main stages:

1. Input Stage – User enters text or uploads/records audio.
2. Processing Stage – Audio is transcribed using Whisper AI, then analyzed using LLM.
3. Output Stage – The system returns structured JSON containing red flags, green flags, health score, grade, and supportive insights.

The application is designed as an awareness and educational tool to promote emotional safety and healthier communication.
